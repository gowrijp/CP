- Check is a Binary Tree is a BST or not  
BST : For any node its left subtree should have nodes lesser in value than the node and the right subtree should have nodes with values larger than the node. So we define the range of every node. 
Root Node can take any value- range(-infinity to inf) ; left node value range(-inf, root node value) ; right node value (root node, inf)
