We have a rectangular region that is 100000 units along the X-axis and 500 units along the Y-axis.

We assume that the origin (0,0) is at the bottom-left corner of this region, so that the top-left corner is at (0,500), the bottom-right at 
(100000,0) and the top-right corner at (100000,500). We are also given the coordinates of a set of N points inside this region. The points have 
only integer coordinates and do not appear along the X-axis or Y-axis.

We would like to draw a rectangle, with its base on the X-axis, of maximum area within the region such that it does not contain any of the N 
points in its interior. More specifically, the points may appear on the boundary but cannot be properly inside the rectangle.

For example, if there are 5 points : (1,4),(2,3),(3,2),(5,1) and (5,2). 
Then the rectangle whose bottom-left and top-right corners are given by (0,0) and (2,3) is a possibility and its area is 6. Another possibility is 
the rectangle with bottom-left and top-right corners at (3,0) and (5,500) with area 1000. The rectangle with bottom-left at (2,3) and top-right at 
(100000,500) is not valid since its base does not lie on the X-axis. The largest rectangle that meets the requirements in this case is the 
one with its bottom-left corner at (5,0) and top-right at (100000,500) with area 49997500.

Your program should take a description of the N points and output the size of the maximum rectangle satisfying the above property that can be 
drawn within the 100000Ã—500 region.
