In country X, colleges pick students strictly based on their scores i.e. students with higher scores get first pick. 
All students have a list of preferences of colleges that they would like to attend, and if on their turn, the number
of seats left in their top choice is 0, they apply to their next choice - so on and so forth, in case none of the 
colleges on a student's preference list has seats left (on their turn), the student doesn't go to college.
Colleges have a fixed number of seats.

The number of students, their test scores, the number of colleges, the number of seats available at each college
and the preference list of every student will be provided.
